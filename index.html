    <h3>So You have a Brilliant idea!
<p>But how do you do it, and who can you find to help?</p></h3>

<p>You could persuade your friends and their friends to pitch in. And it's easy to get advice. You can also hire someone to do it for you. But what if there was a collaborative place where friends and other members meet, because they like the same things you do, and where you can plan your project, so that it was really easy for them to choose the parts they're good at?
